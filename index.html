        <h3>How to Be a Happier Person</h3>
        <p>
         <strong>Cultivate Strong Relationships</strong> So if you are trying to improve your happiness, cultivating solid social connections is a great place to start. Consider deepening your existing relationships and explore ways to make new friends.
          <strong>Get Regular Exercise</strong> Even a little bit of exercise produces a happiness boost—people who were physically active for as little as 10 minutes a day or who worked out only once a week had higher levels of happiness than people who never exercised.
          <strong>Find a Sense of Purpose</strong>
          Research has found that people who feel like they have a purpose have better well-being and feel more fulfilled.14﻿ A sense of purpose involves seeing your life as having goals, direction, and meaning. It may help improve happiness by promoting healthier behaviors.
